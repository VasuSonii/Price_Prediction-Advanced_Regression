# Price_Prediction-Advanced_Regression
I have created this model to predict the Sale price from the housing dataset available on Kaggle. To download the data set visit https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

To implement this jupyter notebook you may need few libraries installed in your system, these libraries comprise of Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib , Scikit-Learn and SeaBorn.To install these libraries refer the following links <br>
For Numpy installation visit https://numpy.org/install/<br>
For Pandas installation visit https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html<br>
For Seaborn installation visit https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html<br>
For Scikit Learn installation visit https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html<br>
For Matplotib installation visit https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html<br>

After installing all the libraries you are ready to go with the project file.<br>
